* Fix issue with dropping ID while de-duplicating gradients ([#207](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/pull/207))
* Improve `--shorten-ids` so it re-maps IDs that are already used in the document if they're shorter ([#187](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/pull/187))
* Fix whitespace handling for SVG 1.2 flowed text ([#235](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/235))
* Improvement: Merge sibling `<g>` nodes with identical attributes ([#208](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/pull/208))
* Improve performance of XML serialization ([#247](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/pull/247))
* Improve performance of gradient de-duplication ([#248](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/pull/248))
* Some general performance improvements ([#249](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/pull/249))

## Version 0.37 (2018-07-04)
* Fix escaping of quotes in attribute values. ([#152](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/pull/152))
* A lot of performance improvements making processing significantly faster in many cases. ([#167](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/pull/167), [#169](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/pull/169), [#171](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/pull/171), [#185](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/pull/185))
* Fix exception when removing duplicated gradients while `--keep-unreferenced-defs` is used ([#173](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/pull/173))
* Remove some illegal optimizations of `m0 0` sub-path commands ([#178](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/pull/178))
* Fix and improve handling of boolean flags in elliptical arc path commands ([#183](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/pull/183))
* Fix exception when shorthand transform `scale(1)` with single number is used ([#191](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/pull/191))
* Fix exception when using two-number forms of the filter attributes `baseFrequency`, `order`, `radius` and `stdDeviation` ([#192](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/pull/192))
* Improve whitespace handling in text nodes fixing an issue where scouring added spaces in error and reducing file size in many cases ([#199](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/pull/199))
* Drop official support for Python 3.3. (While it will probably continue to work for a while compatibility is not guaranteed anymore. If you continue to use Scour with Python 3.3 and should find/fix any compatibility issues pull requests are welcome, though.)


## Version 0.36 (2017-08-06)
* Fix embedding of raster images which was broken in most cases and did not work at all in Python 3. ([#120](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/120))
* Some minor fixes for statistics output.
* Greatly improve the algorithm to reduce numeric precision.
  * Precision was not properly reduced for some numbers.
  * Only use reduced precision if it results in a shorter string representation, otherwise preserve full precision in output (e.g. use "123" instead of "1e2" when precision is set to 1).
  * Reduce precision of lengths in `viewBox` ([#127](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/127))
  * Add option `--set-c-precision` which allows to set a reduced numeric precision for control points.<br/>Control points determine how a path is bent in between two nodes and are less sensitive to a reduced precision than the position coordinates of the nodes themselves. This option can be used to save a few additional bytes without affecting visual appearance negatively.
* Fix: Unnecessary whitespace was not stripped from elliptical paths. ([#89](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/89))
* Improve and fix functionality to collapse straight paths segments. ([#146](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/146))
  * Collapse subpaths of moveto `m` and lineto `l`commands if they have the same direction (before we only collapsed horizontal/vertical `h`/`v` lineto commands).
  * Attempt to collapse lineto `l` commands into a preceding moveto `m` command (these are then called "implicit lineto commands")
  * Do not collapse straight path segments in paths that have intermediate markers. ([#145](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/145))
  * Preserve empty path segments if they have `stroke-linecap` set to `round` or `square`. They render no visible line but a tiny dot or square.


## Version 0.35 (2016-09-14)

* Drop official support for Python 2.6. (While it will probably continue to work for a while compatibility is not guaranteed anymore. If you continue to use Scour with Python 2.6 and should find/fix any compatibility issues pull requests are welcome, though.)
* Fix: Unused IDs were not shortened when `--shorten-ids` was used. ([#19](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/62))
* Fix: Most elements were still removed from `<defs>` when `--keep-unreferenced-defs` was used. ([#62](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/62))
* Improve escaping of single/double quotes ('/") in attributes. ([#64](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/64))
* Print usage information if no input file was specified (and no data is available from `stdin`). ([#65](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/65))
* Redirect informational output to `stderr` when SVG is output to `stdout`. ([#67](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/67))
* Allow elements to be found via `Document.getElementById()` in the minidom document returned by scourXmlFile(). ([#68](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/68))
* Improve code to remove default attribute values and add a lot of new default values. ([#70](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/70))
* Fix: Only attempt to group elements that the content model allows to be children of a `<g>` when `--create-groups` is specified. ([#98](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/98))
* Fix: Update list of SVG presentation attributes allowing more styles to be converted to attributes and remove two entries (`line-height` and `visibility`) that were actually invalid. ([#99](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/99))
* Add three options that work analogous to `--remove-metadata` (removes `<metadata>` elements) ([#102](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/102))
   * `--remove-titles` (removes `<title>` elements)
   * `--remove-descriptions` (removes `<desc>` elements)
   * `--remove-descriptive-elements` (removes all of the descriptive elements, i.e. `<title>`, `<desc>` and `<metadata>`)
* Fix removal rules for the `overflow` attribute. ([#104](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/104))
* Improvement: Automatically order all attributes ([#105](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/105)), as well as `style` declarations ([#107](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/107)) allowing for a constant output across multiple runs of Scour. Before order could change arbitrarily.
* Improve path scouring. ([#108](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/108))<br>Notably Scour performs all calculations with enhanced precision now, guaranteeing maximum accuracy when optimizing path data. Numerical precision is reduced as a last step of the optimization according to the `--precision` option.
* Fix replacement of removed duplicate gradients if the `fill`/`stroke` properties contained a fallback. ([#109](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/109))
* Fix conversion of cubic BÃ©zier "curveto" commands into "shorthand/smooth curveto" commands. ([#110](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/110))
* Fix some issues due to removal of properties without considering inheritance rules. ([#111](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/111))


## Version 0.34 (2016-07-25)

* Add a function to sanitize an arbitrary Python object containing options for Scour as attributes (usage: `Scour.sanitizeOptions(options)`).<br>This simplifies usage of the Scour module by other scripts while avoiding any compatibility issues that might arise when options are added/removed/renamed in Scour. ([#44](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/44))
* Input/output file can now be specified as positional arguments (e.g. `scour input.svg output.svg`). ([#46](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/46))
* Improve `--help` output by intuitively arranging options in groups. ([#46](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/46))
* Add option `--error-on-flowtext` to raise an exception whenever a non-standard `<flowText>` element is found (which is only supported in Inkscape). If this option is not specified a warning will be shown. ([#53](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/53))
* Automate tests with continuous integration via Travis. ([#52](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/52))


## Version 0.33 (2016-01-29)

* Add support for removal of editor data of Sketch. ([#37](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/37))
* Add option `--verbose` (or `-v`) to show detailed statistics after running Scour. By default only a single line containing the most important information is output now.


## Version 0.32 (2015-12-10)

* Add functionality to remove unused XML namespace declarations from the `<svg>` root element. ([#14](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/14))
* Restore unittests which were lost during move to GitHub. ([#24](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/24))
* Fix a potential regex matching issue in `points` attribute of `<polygon>` and `<polyline>` elements. ([#24](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/24))
* Fix a crash with `points` attribute of `<polygon>` and `<polyline>` starting with a negative number. ([#24](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/24))
* Fix encoding issues when input file contained unicode characters. ([#27](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/27))
* Fix encoding issues when using `stding`/`stdout` as input/output. ([#27](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/27))
* Fix removal of comments. If a node contained multiple comments usually not all of them were removed. ([#28](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/28))


## Version 0.31 (2015-11-16)

* Ensure Python 3 compatibility. ([#8](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/8))
* Add option `--nindent` to set the number of spaces/tabs used for indentation (defaults to 1). ([#13](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/13))
* Add option `--no-line-breaks` to suppress output of line breaks and indentation altogether. ([#13](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/13))
* Add option `--strip-xml-space` which removes the specification of `xml:space="preserve"` on the `<svg>` root element which would otherwise disallow Scour to make any whitespace changes in output. ([#13](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/13))


## Version 0.30 (2014-08-05)

* Fix ignoring of additional args when invoked from scons.


## Version 0.29 (2014-07-26)

* Add option `--keep-unreferenced-defs` to preserve elements in `<defs>` that are not referenced and would be removed otherwise. ([#2](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/2))
* Add option to ignore unknown cmd line opts.


## Version 0.28 (2014-01-12)

* Add option `--shorten-ids-prefix` which allows to add a custom prefix to all shortened IDs. ([#1](https://github.com/scour-project/scour/issues/1))
